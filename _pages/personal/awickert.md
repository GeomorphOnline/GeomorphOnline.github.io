## Research interests

I investigate ice, water, and landscapes through the past and present. My tools are physics, computers, sensors, experiments, and geological field observations. I am passionate about unifying theory and observations in Earth-surface dynamics, deciphering the glacial history of North America (and using its ice-sheet-altered rivers as natural experiments about Earth-surface processes), and developing and sharing open-source software and hardware. By centering my work in a physics framework, I seek to build predictive models of modern Earth-surface change that is informed by both short- and long-term records of landscapes, sea level, climate, land use, land cover, and glaciation. My research often takes me to Argentina; Germany; the upper Mississippi River valley; and my desk with my pen, paper, and a comfortable mug of tea.
