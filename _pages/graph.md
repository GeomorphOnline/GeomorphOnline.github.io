# Course Graph

A graph is a mathematical construct that links concepts. Our course is set up as a directed graph of recommended prerequisites to move on through the lessons. Each lesson is a bite-sized chunklet (insert other cute word) of knowledge that hopefully will help learning be more pleasant and less painful.
