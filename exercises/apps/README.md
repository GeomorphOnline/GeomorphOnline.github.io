# Compiled exercise applications

Built artifacts, not source. Each `*.html` / `*.js` pair here is a model
compiled to WebAssembly by [artesian](https://github.com/MNiMORPH/artesian);
the `*.whl` files are the Python wheels the page installs in the reader's
browser via Pyodide.

**The wheels are shared by every exercise in this directory.** `panel` and
`bokeh` are together about 35 MB and are what makes that worth doing: paid
once here, they would otherwise be paid once per exercise. Adding a second
exercise costs roughly 30 KB, not 35 MB. Keep new exercises in this same
directory for that reason.

To rebuild, or to add another:

```sh
pip install artesian
artesian build path/to/your_app.py -o exercises/apps -p path/to/model -r numpy
```

artesian pins `panel` and `bokeh` to whatever versions the build environment
has, so a rebuild does not silently pull new 35 MB wheels into git history.
Upgrading them is a deliberate act.

## Provenance

Record what each application was built from, so a result a student reports can
be reproduced years later. A wheel's version number is not sufficient evidence
on its own: a build from a modified working tree carries the same version as the
release it was branched from, and is indistinguishable by filename.

### grlp_panel — gravel-river long profile

| | |
|---|---|
| model | [GRLP](https://github.com/MNiMORPH/GRLP) **v2.1.0** (tag), the release `pip install grlp` gives |
| application source | GRLP `master` @ `aae1560` (`interactive_demo/grlp_panel.py`) |
| built | 2026-09-02 |
| panel / bokeh | 1.9.4 / 3.9.2 |

| browser requirements | `numpy`, `scipy` |

Verified at build time: every module in the shipped wheel is byte-identical to
the `v2.1.0` tag.

`networkx` is deliberately *not* requested. GRLP gained its river-network code
after v2.1.0, so the tagged release neither imports it nor declares it as a
dependency; asking for it made every reader download about 1 MB of wheel that
was never used.

Do not hand-edit anything here except this file.
