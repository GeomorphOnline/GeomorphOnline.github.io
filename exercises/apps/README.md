# Compiled exercise applications

Built artifacts, not source. Each `*.html` / `*.js` pair here is a model
compiled to WebAssembly by [artesian](https://github.com/MNiMORPH/artesian);
the `*.whl` files are the Python wheels the page installs in the reader's
browser via Pyodide.

**The wheels are shared by every exercise in this directory.** `panel` and
`bokeh` are together about 35 MB and are what makes that worth doing: paid
once here, they would otherwise be paid once per exercise. Adding a second
exercise costs roughly 30 KB, not 35 MB. Keep new exercises in this same
directory for that reason.

To rebuild, or to add another:

```sh
pip install artesian
artesian build path/to/your_app.py -o exercises/apps -p path/to/model -r numpy
```

artesian pins `panel` and `bokeh` to whatever versions the build environment
has, so a rebuild does not silently pull new 35 MB wheels into git history.
Upgrading them is a deliberate act.

## artesian-embed.js

Emitted by every build and **shared by every exercise here**, like the panel and
bokeh wheels. It sizes each demo's frame to its content and, above the app's
design width, scales the demo rather than stretching it. A page embeds an
exercise with

```html
<iframe src="/exercises/apps/<app>.html" data-artesian height="900"></iframe>
<script src="/exercises/apps/artesian-embed.js"></script>
```

and nothing else. Both pages used to carry their own copy of that logic, about
ninety lines each, which is how they both came to have the same bug: an iframe
at `width: 100%` runs off the side of the page on an iPad, because every
browser there is WebKit underneath and WebKit sizes an iframe to its content.
No desktop engine shows it. Rebuilding any app here rewrites the script and
fixes every exercise at once.

The design width is read from a `DESIGN_WIDTH` constant in the app's source and
recorded in its compiled page, so a page never repeats the number.
`grlp_panel` predates that and carries `data-design-width="900"` on its frame
instead; drop the attribute when it is next rebuilt.

## Provenance

Record what each application was built from, so a result a student reports can
be reproduced years later. A wheel's version number is not sufficient evidence
on its own: a build from a modified working tree carries the same version as the
release it was branched from, and is indistinguishable by filename.

### grlp_panel — gravel-river long profile

| | |
|---|---|
| model | [GRLP](https://github.com/MNiMORPH/GRLP) **v2.1.0** (tag), the release `pip install grlp` gives |
| application source | GRLP `master` @ `aae1560` (`interactive_demo/grlp_panel.py`) |
| built | 2026-09-02 |
| panel / bokeh | 1.9.4 / 3.9.2 |

| browser requirements | `numpy`, `scipy` |

Verified at build time: every module in the shipped wheel is byte-identical to
the `v2.1.0` tag.

`networkx` is deliberately *not* requested. GRLP gained its river-network code
after v2.1.0, so the tagged release neither imports it nor declares it as a
dependency; asking for it made every reader download about 1 MB of wheel that
was never used.

### corestone_panel — why a corestone survives

| | |
|---|---|
| model | [corestone](https://github.com/MNiMORPH/corestone) `master` @ `e47c58f` (no release yet) |
| application source | corestone `master` @ `e47c58f` (`interactive_demo/corestone_panel.py`) |
| artesian | `main` @ `44c31d8`, shipped as a wheel because the app imports `artesian.live` |
| built | 2026-09-03 (rebuilt: a third off the demo height) |
| panel / bokeh | 1.9.4 / 3.9.2 |
| browser requirements | `numpy`, `scipy` |

Built from a clean tree at a pushed commit, checked with `git status` before
building. There is no tagged release to build from yet, so the commit is the
provenance; `pip install corestone` does not give a reader the same code.

`artesian` is shipped here, which `grlp_panel` does not do: that app predates
`artesian.live` and hand-rolls its own play/pause. Anything written from
`examples/hillslope.py` imports `artesian.live` and needs the wheel, or it
dies in the browser with `ModuleNotFoundError`.

**Every parameter in the corestone model is a placeholder.** None is measured.
The exercise teaches the mechanism; no number it produces is a rate.

Do not hand-edit anything here except this file.
