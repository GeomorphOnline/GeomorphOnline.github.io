*Final project: Develop a Wikipedia article on a topic in geomorphology.*

## Learning Goals

* Develop professional written communications skills
* Build skills in appropriate scientific citations and referencing
* Gain knowledge in a particular geomorphic topic and/or subfield


## Instructions and Information (from the syllabus)

For this year's final project, students will turn a undeveloped or nonexistent page on Wikipedia into a full-fledged and well-referenced article. This process will include multiple steps over the course of the semester, including:

* Researching and proposing topics to the instructors
* Learning about proper style and referencing; this applies to scientific and professional writing as well.
* Selecting your topic and putting together an initial draft
* Editing and improving the Wikipedia article
* "Finalizing" your contribution following instructor feedback

The [Wikipedia Education Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Education_program/Students) has significant information for students that can help you to set up an account and learn how to manage your project.

* Students enrolled in **ESCI 4701** will work in **pairs**.
* Students enrolled in **ESCI 8701** will work in **alone**.

3. (6 points) For your top-choice article, your proposal must include a detailed response to the three following points:
