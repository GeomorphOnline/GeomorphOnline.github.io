## Learning Goals

* Know the basics of catchment hydrology and about how water moves through watersheds
* Understand the importance of the water balance in a watershed in setting the river discharge

## Videos

### Catchment hydrology

I'm giving you a quick introduction to some core hydrological concepts that will be relevant to thinking of water flowing through watersheds and becoming important for hydrology.

### Landscape evolution

This is a teaser for where we are going. Landscape evolution models, such as this, simulate the two-way feedback between erosion in river channels and changing shapes and areas of drainage basins (i.e., catchments), as well as hillslope processes (here, creep only).
