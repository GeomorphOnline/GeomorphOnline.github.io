*Once we break our conceptualization of the landscape into manageable and understandable chunks that link together to create a broader picture of landscape evolution -- which we will address later in the semester -- we can start to think about how we can put quantifiable predictions forward for how these landscape elements evolve and change. This is the essence of the idea behind developing "geomorphic transport laws".*

## Learning Goals

* Conceptually understand geomorphic transport laws
* Learn broadly how the landscape filters, responds to, and records external changes
* Conceptually connect geomorphic process domains and transport laws
