## Learning Goals

* Know landform names, what they are, and a little bit about how they form

## Video

This hour-long video by Amit Sengupta takes you through definitions of landforms using illustrations above a key diagram. I would suggest that you watch as much as you feel you need to have a good working knowledge. I expect that different students will need to spend different amounts of time on this depending on prior knowledge.

## Google Expeditions Augmented Reality (AR)

This will allow you to project landforms onto a surface and move around them from a bird's-eye view. Take some time looking at them and internalizing them.
