## Learning Goals

* Become acquainted with the course and how topics and assignments are arranged
* Take a critical look at landscapes and landforms
* Jump into interpreting a landscape with a VR tour of Grand Canyon

## What is a landscape?

A landscape is a collection of features and forms on Earth's surface, which are individually called landforms. As **geomorphologists**, we seek to understand the observed landforms and learn to read the information that they tell us about how a place formed. From this, we can gain knowledge about the underlying processes sculpting Earth's surface and develop predictive models for landscape evolution into the past and future.

For a decent quick overview with some nice images, the [Wikipedia article on landforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape) is decent.

## Syllabus

Read the [syllabus](/syllabus/)!

## Google Expeditions 3D/VR

[Explore the Grand Canyon](https://expeditions.gle/fdl/wmPf)

This set of images has a set of questions that go along with them. They are interesting, and the geology ones can be quite relevant! However, we are not quite so concerned with them for the class.

## Open-ended thinking assignment

**Deliverable**

Describe in your words and/or diagrams
* The landforms that you see
* Whether you can note zones of distinct geometries and processes
* How the landscape is responding to the incision of Grand Canyon
It's okay if you feel that you do not have the right vocabulary or background. In fact, it's expected! The idea here is to get the juices flowing and start developing your critical eye for landforms and landscape features. Just by looking closely, you should be able to see signs that show you how Grand Canyon developed and continues to form.
