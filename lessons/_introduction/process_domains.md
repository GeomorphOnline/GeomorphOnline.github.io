*To better understand landscapes, we separate our conceptualization of landforms and the processes that form them into different "geomorphic process domains".*

## Learning Goals

* Be able to define a **geomorphic process domain**
* Understand why we separate the continuous and interconnected landscape into discrete process domains
* Know the definitions of **conceptual** and **mathematical models**
* Know some common process domains that we will investigate throughout this course.

## Video

### Introduction

This first video is a basic introduction to process domains as well as conceptual and mathematical models.

Between this first and second video, reflect for a little bit and think of and/or write down what you think a few geomorphic process domains might be. Try to justify your decisions based on how you might be able to best isolate one important set of processes acting on the landscape from another.
