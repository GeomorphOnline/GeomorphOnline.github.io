## Learning Goals



## Notes (with questions)

[Surveying notes PDF with annotations from the video read-through](/assets/notes/01_Surveying_withNotes.pdf). *IMPORTANT: I created this walk-through before correcting Equation 3 (+ to -) and the following reference to table ~3~2, as well as before defining "standard deviation" as Ïƒ. Please use this as it helps, but refer to the above unannotated notes as the more definitive version.*

## Videos

### Lecture notes run-through by Wickert:

*See comment above: my work through these notes is still valid, but the notes themselves are deprecated in a couple small but oh-so-critical spots for completing the problem set.*

### Other useful videos for further learning

#### Leveling an instrument

Leveling surveying equipment can be hard, especially if you are new to it! This is a good quick beginner's guide.

#### Introduction to RTK GNSS

This technology is one that many of you may end up using professionally.

## Problem Set (Deliverable)

Perform the following exercises from the notes:

### Pacing (10 points)

Complete the "pacing" exercise and calculate your pace (**Section 2.2**).

**Hand in:**
* Table of pacing tests
* A map of where you paced (an annotated screenshot will suffice)
* Your average pace length.

### Leveling (25 points)

* **(10 pts)** Compute the solution for the leveling survey in **Section 4.1** of the notes.
* **(15 pts)** Compute the error propagation in **Section 4.2** of the notes (**See Canvas announcement for corrections to Equation 2 and the text for this section. Use data from Table 2, not Table 3.**). Answer both questions (1) (10
points) and (2) (5 points) from the end of this section

### Cross-section (10 points)

Plot a full cross-sectional profile across the hypothetical section of river valley **(Section 5 of the notes)**, incluidng the channel bottom, floodplain, and water surface. You may find it useful to use a spreadsheet or a computer-programming-based method of plotting to generate this cross section, though we will of course accept solutions performed by hand on graph paper (and submitted electronically).
