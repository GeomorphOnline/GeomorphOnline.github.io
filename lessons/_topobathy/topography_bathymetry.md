## Learning Goals

* Define "topography" and "bathymetry"
* Learn about Earth's large-scale "hyposometry": its distribution of elevations.

*[From Robert Stern, UT Dallas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypsometry#/media/File:EarthHypso.png).* Earth's hypsometry is bimodal, split between the deep ocean basins and the high continents. Think about how plate tectonics produces this, and how this may make us unique when compared to other planetary bodies.

<!-- ## Assignment

**Deliverable:** Zoom in on a specific section of the etopo1 topogrpahic/bathymetric map. (To see it in its fill size, right-click and then "open image in new tab".) Take a screenshot and annotate it into different geomorphic process domains. Your chosen zone must include at least two separate process domains: no fair taking a capture of the Greenland Ice Sheet! You can do this in any software of your choice. Then, write a paragraph describing your decision-making process. -->

## Google Expeditions 3D/VR

Purely for your own fun! We will not be focusing too much on bathymetry in this class, but if you want to see the kinds of ships that take scientific measurements, check out this VR tour of the
[Research Vessel Sonne](https://tour-repo.appspot.com/view_tour/Aboard_the_German_research_vessel_SONNE).
