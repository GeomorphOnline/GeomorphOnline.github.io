*Open-channel flow velocity is proportional to shear velocity.*

## Learning Goals

* Relate flow velocity to shear velocity via the Chézy Formula.
* Understand its relationship to flow depth and the eventual reframing of the Chézy coefficient by Manning to take flow depth into account.

## The formula

For quick reference; see course notes and video for derivation:

$$\bar{u} = C_z u_\tau$$
