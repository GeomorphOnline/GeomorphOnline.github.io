*Rigorous derivation of turbulent mixing (Prandtl) and the boundary-layer fluid-velocity profile.*

## Learning Goals

* Understand how turbulent mixing exchanges momentum (and therefore, velocity) up and down through the water column
* Learn how this turbulent exchange creates a different velocity profile than would be expected for a laminar flow
* Relate stress and strain in both laminar and turbulent flows
* Define the bed roughness, $z_0$

## The Law of the Wall: The Equation

For quick reference; see course notes and videos for derivation:

$$u(z) = \frac{u_\tau}{\kappa} \ln\left(\frac{z}{z_0}\right)$$

## Prandtl Turbulent Mixing

Covers both laminar (i.e., viscous) and turbulent transfer of momentum through a flow, and defines the eddy viscosity (though I only note that exact term in passing at the end).

## Law of the Wall

Steps to derive the turbulent velocity profile based on Prandtl turbulence theory. This also includes the formal definition of the shear velocity.

## The roughness length, $$z_0$$

Estimating $$z_0$$ from grain size and the thickness of the laminar sublayer.
