*Internal resistance to flow.*

## Learning Goals

* Learn about the assumptions of steady and uniform flow and what they mean
* Know how to compute a backwater length and that this is the zone in which the steady, uniform flow assumption does not apply

## Steady, uniform flow computer-graphics illustration

The robot voice may be strange, but it is right!

## Video lecture

Here I discuss steady flow, uniform flow, and how to tell when a backwater effect may be present.

Note that we consider the question of steady, uniform flow purely in the downsteram direction. Natural flows do vary across the channel.

## Unsteady and nonuniform flow example: dam-breach experiment

## Steady, uniform flow examples

### Slow-moving river

You don't have to watch all 3 hours!

### Mountain stream

When averaged over short periods of time, such that the turbulent cascade averages out, flow in this river (believe it or not!) is also steady and uniform.
