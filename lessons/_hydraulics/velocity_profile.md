*Turbulent flow is characterized by eddies, which produce fluctuations in the velocity of the flow.*

## Learning Goals

* Understand no-slip and free-slip boundary conditions
* See what a river velocity profile looks like
* Be introduced to a number of ways of calculating flow velocity and velocity profiles in open channels
