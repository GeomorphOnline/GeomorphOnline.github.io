*Does the flow remain smooth and orderly or does it devolve into the chaos of a hundred kindergartners who all speak different languages racing around a playground trying to catch butterflies?*

## Learning Goals

* Understand the difference between laminar and turbulent flow.
* Know what the Reynolds number is and how it can be used to find whether a flow is likely to be laminar or turbulent.
* Know how to calculate the Reynolds number in practical situations.
* Know that flow in typical natural rivers is very turbulent.

## Video examples of laminar and turbulent flow

***Water jet that is transitional from laminar to turbulent.***

Be warned! [Fjord-cat](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EfwTP3EXkAEZf4b.jpg) ran to the door to ask to be let outside shortly after this video started! It'll make sense why... (Alas, it was the day after the October 2020 snowstorm when I played it, and she had to wrestle with the idea of getting her paws wet and cold.)

Note how the dye streams are visible (laminar) and turn into a well-mixed cloud (turbulent). The folks running the experiment are changing its velocity only slightly.
