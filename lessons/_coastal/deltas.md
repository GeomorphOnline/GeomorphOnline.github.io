*When rivers reach the ocean, they drop their sediments and create some of the most biodiverse and exceptional(ly flat yet complex) landforms in the world.*

## Learning Goals

* Know how sea level and river deltas interact.
* Connect deltas and global change

## A little background

Here's the essential classification of river deltas, as influenced by waves, tides, and rivers:

## Coastal landforms beyond deltas

* Waves create spits and beaches
* Tides and rivers create mudflats and tidal marshes; these grow and shrink in a complex interplay between coastal ecology, geomorphic processes, and sea-level change. (I'll record and upload my lecture on this if someone is interested and writes me.)
* Barrier islands form and are shaped by waves, tides, sediment supply via rivers, and sea-level change
