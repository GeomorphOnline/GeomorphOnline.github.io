*Sediment can move along the bed, in low suspension, or high in the flow.*

## Learning Goals
* Know the major modes of sediment transport.
* Gain intuition into what these modes look like and how they interact (or don't) with the bed.
* Connect your knowledge of fluid flow to understand why the Rouse Number describes the sediment-transport mode.

## Definitions

* **Bed load**: Sediment that rolls, slides, or saltates (jumps/bounces) along or near the bed.
* **Suspended load**: Sediment that rides higher in the water column for some time; it may then may come back to rest on the bed, or may be carried high in the flow for a long time.
* **Bed material load**: The bed load and portion of the suspended load that falls back to the bed; literally, the transported load of all material that interacts and exchanges with the river bed.
* **Wash load**: Sediment that is carried easily by the water and does not interact with the bed. This is an extreme case of suspended load.
* **Dissolved load**: Dissolved material within the flow.

## Sediment in rivers

### Suspended and wash load delivery to the sea

![Connecticut River](https://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/52000/52059/groton_tm5_2011245.jpg)

The Connecticut River sends significant suspended sediment (suspended load + wash load) to Long Island Sound.

### Sediment motion in a large flume

Enjoy this classic video from [SAFL](https://www.safl.umn.edu/). Note that besides the gravel being discussed, suspended finer particles are whizzing by.

### Sand and gravel transport in a rapid flow

Recall that shear stress is proportional to $$\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}z}$$. Therefore, this high-velocity but shallow flow can exert significant shear stress on the bed and move sediment.

## Sediment transport modes

### Animated diagram

This animated diagram of modes of sediment transport, while brief, provides the key definitions.

### Description of some modes of sediment transport

If you want a bit more than is supplied above, this description of sediment transport includes:
* Two methods of bed-load transport: rolling/sliding and saltation
* Suspended-load transport
* Dissolved-load transport
It does not include wash load.

As always, when watching these UK-style physical geography videos, replace "energy" with "shear stress".

### What determines sediment-transport modes?

* Sediment falls back to the bed at a settling velocity, $$w_s$$. This is a terminal velocity -- that is, the velocity at which the forces pulling the particle downward are balanced by upwards drag, such that the particle stops accelerating.
* Sediment is concentrated near the bed, and this is mixed upwards into the flow at a rate given by turbulent mixing -- $$\kappa u_\tau$$. Recall from earlier that $$u_\tau$$ is the shear velocity and $$\kappa$$ is von Kármán's constant.

Combining these provides the Rouse Number, $$P$$, a dimensionless number providing the

$$P = \frac{w_s}{\kappa u_\tau}$$

As the Rouse number becomes higher, the settling velocity wins, and the material turns into bed load. As the Rouse number becomes lower, the material becomes carried as suspended load.
