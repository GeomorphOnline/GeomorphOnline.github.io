*Alluvial river planforms tell us about the processes of channel change that they undergo.*

## Learning Goals
* Know the names of typical alluvial-river planforms: straight, meandering, braided, and anastomosing
* Connect these with the processes of river-channel motion and change: lateral migration and avulsion

## Channel patterns and dynamics

## Why do rivers meander?

## Laboratory experiments

Laboratory experiments are among the best ways to study and analyze river behaviors. They allow us to demonstrate river-channel change over time scales that we can watch -- instead of needing centuries of repeat maps!

The following experiments compare meandering and braided systems; the meandering river forms because cohesive sediment is used to create the surface into which it carves its course. The cohesionless sand in the braided-river case promotes unconfined flow and what is thermed the "braiding instability" -- which leads to this form of river.

Note: the version with overhead images, below, has the meandering river on the bottom instead of the top.
