*Conservation of mass and (assuming incompressibility) volume.*

## Learning Goals

* Know what *conservation* means in physics
* Understand that conservation of volume follows from conservation of mass with the simplifying assumption that the material being conserved is incompressible (i.e. must stay at a constant density)
* Understand how conservation principles can be connected with addition and subtraction of material to change the amount of material in a container
