*Balancing and conserving mass is the key to link discharge of mobile hillslope material to landscape form.*

## Learning Goals

* Link a discharge (or flux) rule to a conservation-of-mass statement to construct a diffusion equation
* Intuit how this equation may predict rates of erosion and/or deposition across hillslopes
