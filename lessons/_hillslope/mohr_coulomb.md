*Landslides occur when driving forces, modified by slope and rainfall, overcome resisting forces, which depend on pore-fluid pressure and cohesive strength of the hillslope.*

## Learning Goals

* Understand Mohr-Coulomb failure
* Know the driving and resisting forces for landslides
* Understand the concept of "incipient failure"

## Mohr-Coulomb Failure

The apprpoach used here, in which I compare driving (weight, slope) and resisting (frictional + cohesive - pore-fluid) stresses is called Mohr-Coulomb failure analysis.
