*Wind can bring in new sediments and can scour and erode bedrock and loose material, affecting the mass balance of hillslopes.*

## Learning Goals

* Understand how source and sink terms work in differential equations
* Know how aeolian processes can affect mass balance on hillslopes

## Podcast

This is a quick review of hillslope processes: where we've come from, and where we're going.

## Videos

### Background: Loessic landscapes

This video includes some background on landscapes formed in wind-blown sediment while perhaps slightly overdoing the "China is amazing" theme. In a mostly cute way.

Note: I say and write "venefact" when I mean "ventifact"! It turns out that this is something that I've only ever heard in lectures myself, and I heard it wrong. Replace that word in your mind.
