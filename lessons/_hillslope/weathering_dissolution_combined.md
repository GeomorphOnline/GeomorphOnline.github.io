*Weathering, dissolution, and soil-production functions: linking the terms that together set rates of hillslope evolution.*

## Learning Goals

* Learn about dimensions and nonlinearities when assembling differential equations
* Understand how soil-production functions feed into models of hillslope evolution
* Include dissolution in a hillslope mass balance
* See how a full equation can be constructed by summing the multiple individual processes affecting a system

## Video

This takes you through the remaining pieces of a full equation for hillslope diffusion and conservation of mass.
