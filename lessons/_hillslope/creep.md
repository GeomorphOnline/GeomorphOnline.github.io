*Many processes cause the rate of downslope motion of hillslope material to be proportional to the gradient (slope) of the hillside.*

## Learning Goals

* Consider many different processes that may impact motion of material on hillslopes
* Note that many of them from very different sources (physical, biological) cause a similar outcome of downslope motion of hillslope material
* Write an ordinary differential equation to describe this motion

### Mechanisms of downslope motion

(Including slight reference to other mechanisms -- abrasion, dissolution -- as well)

### Slope-proportional soil creep

Continuing our discussion of soil creep and then generalizing the many mechanisms that produce downslope soil motion into a mathematical representation.
