*Why are hilltops round? More specifically, why are they parabolic?*

## Learning Goals

* Rounded hililtops are the rule in nature.
* Derive how this is consistent with hillslope diffusion.
* Gain intuition for how hills steepen with higher river incision rates and lower diffusivity (erodibility).
* Gain practice in separating variables to solve differential equations.
