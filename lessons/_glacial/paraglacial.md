*Paraglacial processes, or the non-glaciated landscape processes directly impacted by glaciation, can have far-reaching and long-lasting impacts on the landscape, even after ice has retreated.*

## Learning Goals
* Explain the role of glaciation in the context of the larger landscape.
* Underline the complexities of post-glacial landscape response.
* Investigate the impacts of glaciation on the Santa Cruz River, Argentina.

## The Santa Cruz River and Paraglacial Processes
*What does paraglacial mean and how can we begin to think about paraglacial environments? In this video I discuss some of my key research questions and the complexities of post-glacial landscape evolution.*
