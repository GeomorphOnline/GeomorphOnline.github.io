## Learning Goals

* Glacial sliding and Erosion
* Be able to construct a basic block diagram for glacial flow and identify the forces at play on the block.
* Understanding of basal shear stresses and glacial sliding. Cold vs warm beds.
* Overview of glacial sediment and controls on the types of glacial sediment (large blocks from plucking, dissolution of bed, fine glacial till)

## Overview

**Glaciers.** You've definitely heard of them and, at this time of year in Minnesota, can probably imagine what it would be like to actually visit one. But, what are they and how do they work to shape landscapes and landscape processes? In this "week" of our course I'll be taking you through the basics of glacial processes and how these processes, in turn, shape landscapes.

>Here's a picture I took back in March of our team (including Andy) walking across the Perito Moreno glacier in Patagonia, Argentina.

We'll begin by learning a bit about glacial erosion and glacial sliding so that we can understand what goes on directly within and around the ice to shape landscapes.

Then, we'll move to an overview of glacial landforms, to see the direct implications of glacial erosion and sliding on the landscape as the glacier moves through it (from small, centimeter-scale glacial striations to miles-long moraine complexes).

Finally, we'll learn about paraglacial landscape evolution, or the non-glacial processes that are directly triggered by glaciation. These processes can extend far beyond the ice margin and persist long after the glacial ice has melted. In fact, Minnesota is still currently experiencing many processes that could be described as paraglacial that were triggered by the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which covered much of Canada and parts of Minnesota at the Last Glacial Maximum (around 20,000 years ago).

There's a lot more to glaciers and glacial geology than we can possibly cover in this short week. But, my hope is that you'll come away from this week with a new appreciation of the massive geomorphic power of glaciation and how landscapes– past, present, and future– are shaped by glacial processes.

## Glacier Mass Balance
Glaciers are, generally, quite large (though that is becoming increasingly not the case, due to climate warming). As someone that has been fortunate to work on a glacier, I can confirm this simple fact.

>The Perito Moreno glacier is approximately 19 miles long and covers roughly 97 square miles with ice. Here's a picture of me as scale to show just how large this glacier really is.

Because glaciers are large and because they're on the Earth's surface, gravity acts upon them and causes them to flow. However, you may have noticed that glaciers do not simply slip downhill, leaving no ice behind as they do so. Instead, as glaciers flow, ice closer to the edge of the glacier (what we call the *terminus*) melts while, near the top of the glacier (the *head*) ongoing snowfall allows for the generation of new glacial ice.

This process, known as glacier mass balance is (as the name would imply) a balance between melting (*ablation*) and growing (*accumulation*) ice and allows for the glacier to flow continuously.

This short, very high quality video that gives an overview of glacier mass balance, including accumulation, ablation, and where these two processes are equal (what we call the *the Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA)*).
