*Glacial landforms record glacial erosion and deposition long after ice has retreated and can have far-reaching implications for the geomorphic evolution of the landscape.*

## Learning Goals
* Some landforms and how they look in the landscape

## Glacial Landforms
As a glacier flows down its path, its ice is constantly moving and shifting the environment around it. From trees, to rivers, to mountainsâ€“ little can stand in the way of a glacier. As a result, during this (often thousands of years long) flow of ice and material, rocks and debris are picked up, ground down, eroded, and deposited by the ever-shifting sea of ice.

However, though the actual processes of glacial erosion and deposition require the presence of glacier ice, the by-products of this erosion and deposition can be preserved in the landscape long after glacier ice has retreated, with the dynamics of glacial erosion and deposition preserved for all to see long after that story has ended.

In this section we will walk through a subsample of some of the **types of landforms that are generated by glaciation**. This is, by no means, an exhaustive list of the complex ways glaciers modify the landscape. Instead, this is meant to give you a good picture of the variety of scales over which glaciers can rework their environments and how **the results of glacial erosion and deposition can be seen on the landscape long after glacier ice has retreated**.

## Landforms on Many Scales
It is important to note that glacial landforms often occur on a variety of scales and can often be seen overprinted on top of each other (glaciers are quite good at their job of reworking the landscape, after all). Thus, it is important to keep in mind that a massive, hundred kilometer-long glacial lake that was formed as a glacier scoured out a lake valley can also have small, millimeter sized glacial sediment deposits that were also ground down and left by the mighty glacier. As a result, **glacial features can be seen on all scales, from millimeters to kilometers**.

## A Bit about My Research and the Glacial History of Minnesota
In this section I define a number of glacial landforms through images from my fieldwork in Argentina to highlight what these landforms look like in a real-world, field setting. Though many of these photos are quite obviously from a glacial setting (i.e. taken standing on a glacier), it is actually possible to spot glacial features anywhere glaciation has taken place!

Minnesota is a prime example of this, with its own complex glacial history. Most places you visit in the state are shaped (and still being shaped (more on this in the next section!)) by glaciation. In fact, many of the features I highlight here can be spotted in and around Minnesota! If you're interested in learning more about this, I highly recommend checking out this website (put together by our own CSE) on Minnesota's glacial history: https://cse.umn.edu/mgs/glacial-geology.

## Glacial Erosional Landforms

**Glacial erosional landforms** are, as the name would imply, formed by the process of glacial erosion.

### Outcrop Scale
**Glacial polish** is bedrock that has been scoured and polished by glacial erosion. These smooth bedrock faces are often marked with many other glacial erosional markings including glacial striations.

**Glacial striations** are scratches in the bedrock made by pebbles and debris as they are dragged across by glacial ice. Because of their linear nature, we can use glacial striations to narrow down the direction of ice flow. However, since we can't tell which of the two directions the ice was flowing based solely on glacial striations, we often need other clues (including other types of glacial features) to tell us the direction of glacial ice. In the image below, I knew the ice flow direction based on the position of the modern glacier, but many times we are not that lucky!

> A photo of polished bedrock and glacial striations near the Upsala Glacier. We used these polished bedrock surfaces to take samples to determine when glacial ice last covered the rock. Polished bedrock was ideal for our sampling because nothing has covered this surface since the glacier last flowed over it (likely around the Little Ice Age (~1500 BC) or so).

It is important to note on the image above that there are also many bedrock fractures in the outcrop. These are formed from other geologic processes and not by pebbles sliding across the outcrop. A great example of how you can have many geologic processes (faulting, fracturing, rock weathering **and** glacial erosion) overprinting each other in a field setting.

**Glacial chatter marks** are a series of wedge shaped marks form from the sequential chipping of the bedrock surface by rock fragments dragged by glacial ice. As the glacier continues to flow, the fragment will become caught on the bedrock face until it builds up enough pressure to jump to another point of the bedrock, where it gets stuck again, creating a sequence of marks. I like to think of these as "footprints" of a small pebble, long since carried away by glacier ice!
