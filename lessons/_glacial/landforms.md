*Glacial landforms record glacial erosion and deposition long after ice has retreated and can have far-reaching implications for the geomorphic evolution of the landscape.*

## Learning Goals
* Some landforms and how they look in the landscape

## Glacial Landforms
Erosion and subsequent deposition by a glacier has massive power to rework and reshape the landscape. However, though the actual processes of glacial erosion and deposition require the presence of glacier ice, the by-products of this erosion and deposition can be preserved in the landscape long after glacier ice has retreated. In this section we will walk through a subsample of some of the **types of landforms that are generated by glaciation**. This is, by no means, an exhaustive list of the complex ways glaciers modify the landscape. Instead, this is meant to give you a good picture of the variety of scales over which glaciers can rework their environments and how **the results of glacial erosion and deposition can be seen on the landscape long after glacier ice has retreated**.


## Glacial Erosional Landforms
*Glacial erosional landforms are, as the name would imply, formed by the process of glacial erosion. In this short video I describe a number of glacial erosional landforms through images from my fieldwork in Argentina to highlight what these landforms look like in a real-world, field setting.*
