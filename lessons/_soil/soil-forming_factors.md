*Soils form in response to five key factors: Climate, Organisms, Relief, Parent Material, and Time.*

## Learning Goals

* Learn the five factors of soil formation
* Learn a bit about the processes by which soils develop

## Five Factors: Hans Jenny (1941)

[Adapted from P.H. Larson]

**Cl,O,R,P,T**

* **Climate** -- Temperature and moisture (precipitation, humidity)
  * Temperature speeds up or slows down chemical reactions that break down or weather rocks and minerals.
  * Moisture content determines degree of leaching through soil
* **Organisms** -- soils chemically altered and physically mixed by:
  * Burrowing animals
  * Growing plant roots
  * Enzyme-secreting bacteria and fungi
* **Relief** -- Topography. The slope and direction a landscape faces influences:
  * Sunlight hours
  * Temperature
  * Water runoff
  * Erosion
  * Organic and mineral matter build-up.
* **Parent Material**
  * The chemical composition of original unweathered rock (or till, or wind-blown sediments, or...) influences the mineral content of the soil.
* **Time**
  & More time provides more opportunity for the above four factors to form a soil
  * Older soils are more weathered
  * Soil residence time can be reflected in the degree of soil development

## Soil-development processes

Soils form following the above factors via these processes

* **Addition**
  * Organic matter accumulation: Things die on the surface (plants, animals) and below the surface (plant roots, burrowing animals)
  * Inorganic matter accumulation
    * Dust
    * Regolith production
    * Sediment deposition
* **Loss**
  * Erosion -- stripping of organic and mineral content from the surface (e.g., by wind, water, ice)
  * Dissolution -- removal of minerals within the soil in solution
* **Transformation**
  * Decomposition of primary minerals into secondary minerals
  * Translocation (movement of material within soils)
* **Leaching** = movement of dissolved matter via groundwater in a soil.  May move it within the soil or carry dissolved matter out of the soil completely.
  * Leaching from upper soil units into deeper soil units (can carry materials down via water that changes pH, gas content, and redox as the water evaporates).
  * Leaching from parent material or organic matter.


## Video

Jerry Delsol has an excellent introduction to these processes that I've used to help myself learn! It's far better than anything that I could make, so here you are:
