*Soils form via four major processes: addition, loss, transformation, and leaching.*

## Learning Goals

* Learn the four processes by which soils develop.

## Acknowledgment

The list of soil-forming processes is lifted near-verbatim from [Prof. Phil Larson's](https://sbs.mnsu.edu/academics/geography/faculty-and-staff/phillip-larson/) Physical Geography course.

## Soil-forming processes

Soils form through the following set of processes:

* **Addition**
  * Organic matter accumulation: Things die on the surface (plants, animals) and below the surface (plant roots, burrowing animals)
  * Inorganic matter accumulation
    * Dust
    * Regolith production
    * Sediment deposition
* **Loss**
  * Erosion -- stripping of organic and mineral content from the surface (e.g., by wind, water, ice)
  * Dissolution -- removal of minerals within the soil in solution
* **Transformation**
  * Decomposition of primary minerals into secondary minerals
  * Translocation (movement of material within soils)
* **Leaching** = movement of dissolved matter via groundwater in a soil.  May move it within the soil or carry dissolved matter out of the soil completely.
  * Leaching from upper soil units into deeper soil units (can carry materials down via water that changes pH, gas content, and redox as the water evaporates).
  * Leaching from parent material or organic matter.


## Video

Jerry Delsol again has a great introduction, here to these soil-forming factors:
